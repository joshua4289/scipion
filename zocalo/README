This is a DLS specific zocalo folder 
consumers contains  all the consumers 
the individual entry points that scipion calls  are in their respective software/em/package_name
so the scipion.conf is not different in terms of the names of the files BUT those files are symlinked to zocalo recipie submitter scripts
this ensures that the original binaries don't exist anymore and the folder is clean instead of having the old bits lying around  
start_services is with the packaged consumers
